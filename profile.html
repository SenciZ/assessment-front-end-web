      <p>
        A Compaq Presario 5724 with its 64MB of RAM, Microsoft FrontPage, and a
        1000HR AOL disc. That is how I was introduced to anything web and
        graphic design-related. The year is 1996, with CSS not yet introduced
        and the DIV tag barely supported, the web pages were anything but
        masterpieces, however, I was hooked.

      <p>
        Fast forward to 2021, after more than a decade honing my visual skills
        in the graphic design/print industry, dozens of table-based 2000â€™s
        websites, and several Flash and ActionScript websites later, I am
        excited to move into the captivating field of Web Development. I hope to
        now combine my love of visually appealing graphics with my passion for
        learning to control outputs on the computer screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having worked in the graphic industry for over 15 years I have learned
        to be an extraordinary team player and at the same time work solely and
        be responsible for the success or failure of multiple projects at one
        time. As a business owner, I have acquired skills that allow me to tune
        in with my past and potential employers and understand the amount of
        work, commitment, and sacrifice that they have to put in towards their
        business and dreams. All of which will make me a great asset to any team
        or organization I work for.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next year, I aim to be employed within the tech field working
        alongside senior developers to learn from them while also utilizing my
        unique skills and background to help them innovate and produce a better
        product for their clients. My 5-year goal involves me becoming extremely
        versed in my current stack of PostgreSQL, Express, React.js, and Node.js
        while also learning other tech such as Vue.js, Angular, MongoDB, C# with
        .NET and iOS to name a few. While on my way to my 5-year goal I intend
        to mentor incoming devs to help them along in their path just as others
        might have done for me.
